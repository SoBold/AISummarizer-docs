# Source Control

## Branches

We primarily work on a single branch: `release/v1.0.0`. This branch represents our first version (v1) of the plugin, which is our production release.

Once we go live with v1, we will create a new `develop` branch. This branch will be used for adding new features and fixing any bugs before they are pushed to production.

Before merging into the `develop` branch, all features and bug fixes must be developed on custom branches. These custom branches will then be submitted as pull requests into the `develop` branch for review.
