# Future Scope: Token-Based Summarization

## Overview

Provide users with a token-based summarization system, removing the dependency on specific providers like AWS. This system will offer a cost-effective, pay-as-you-go model for summarizing content.

## Key Features

-   **Multi-Provider Compatibility**: Tokens can work with various summarization models without needing direct accounts with those services.
-   **Usage Dashboard**: Admin interface to track token usage and top-ups.

## Benefits

-   Simplified access for non-technical users.
-   Monetization opportunity for the plugin developer.
