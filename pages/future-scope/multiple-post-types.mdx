# Future Scope: Support for Multiple Post Types

## Overview

Currently, the plugin supports summarizing one post type. In future versions, we plan to allow users to select multiple post types for summarization, improving usability for diverse content workflows.

## Key Features

-   **Multi-Post Type Selection**: Enable configuration of multiple post types via the admin dashboard.
-   **Granular Summarization Control**: Per-post-type customization for summarization style, length, and display options.

## Benefits

-   Enhanced functionality for blogs, e-commerce, and portfolio websites.
-   Saves time by summarizing various content types simultaneously.
