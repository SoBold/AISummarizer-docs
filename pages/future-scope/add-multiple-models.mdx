# Future Scope: Add Support for Multiple AI Providers

## Overview

Expanding beyond AWS Bedrock, we can integrate additional AI models like OpenAI's GPT, Google's PaLM (via Vertex AI), and others. This allows users greater flexibility and accessibility to their preferred AI services.

## Key Features

-   **OpenAI Integration**: Summarization using OpenAI's GPT API.
-   **Google PaLM Integration**: Summarization via Google Cloud's generative AI models.
-   **Custom Provider Support**: Enable users to add their own provider keys for summarization.

## Benefits

-   Increased accessibility for users without AWS accounts.
-   Broader use cases by supporting different AI ecosystems.
