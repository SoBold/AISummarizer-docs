# Interface (AiModelInterface)

The `AiModelInterface` interface defines the contract for AI models used in text summarization. Any class that implements this interface must provide an implementation for the `summarize` method.

## Namespace

```php
namespace AISummarizer\Interfaces;
```

## Description

This interface is part of the AI_Summarizer plugin and provides a standardized method for summarizing content across different AI models. Implementing this interface ensures that all AI models have a consistent method for generating summaries.

## Methods

### `summarize(string $content)`: string

**Description**
Summarizes the given content.

**Returns:**

-   `string`: Returns the summarized content as a string. The summarized content is expected to be a shorter version of the input, capturing the main ideas or points.

**Parameters:**

-   `string $content`: The content to be summarized. This should be a string containing the full text or information that needs to be condensed into a summary.

### Example Usage

```php
namespace AISummarizer\Models;

use AISummarizer\Interfaces\AiModelInterface;

class SomeAiModel implements AiModelInterface
{
    /**
     * Summarizes the given content.
     *
     * @param string $content The content to summarize.
     *
     * @return string The summarized content.
     */
    public function summarize(string $content): string
    {
        // Implement your summarization logic here
        return "This is a summary of the content."; // Placeholder implementation
    }
}
```

### Summary

The AiModelInterface serves as a blueprint for any AI model that is used for summarization within the AI_Summarizer plugin. By adhering to this interface, developers can ensure compatibility and consistent functionality across different AI summarization implementations.
